			<h2>Welcome to my Website!</h2>
			<p>On 23<sup>rd</sup> March 2018 I went on a solo trip to Japan which was my first time travelling alone. I had the best time and I cannot wait to be able to go there again.</p>
			<p>I decided to go on an organised tour which was arranged by a company called Inside Japan. It was an all-inclusive small group tour and we visited many different places. I think I stayed in a total of 7 different hotels over 19 days!</p>
			<p>I flew from Manchester Airport and even got to see the Northern Lights during the overnight flight! It was amazing. I flew to Tokyo and spent the first 2 days there, before taking a bullet train to Hiroshima. We then went to Kyoto, Kaga Onsen, Kanazawa and then back to Tokyo again for the last few days.</p>
			<p>The main reason I wanted to visit Japan was to see all of the beautiful cherry blossom trees! 
			I was so lucky to have booked on the exact dates that the cherry trees were expected to bloom.</p>
